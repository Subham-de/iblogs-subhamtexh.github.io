        <p><i>Web3 is distinct from Tim Berners-Lee's 1999 concept for a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee
                described
                the Semantic Web as a component of Web 3.0, which is different from the meaning of Web3 in blockchain
                contexts.[19]

                The term "Web3" was coined by Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014, referring to
                a
                "decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain."[1] In 2021, the idea of Web3 gained
                popularity.[20]
                Particular interest spiked toward the end of 2021, largely due to interest from cryptocurrency
                enthusiasts
                and investments from high-profile technologists and companies.[5][6] Executives from venture capital
                firm
                Andreessen Horowitz traveled to Washington, D.C., in October 2021 to lobby for the idea as a potential
                solution to questions about regulation of the web, with which policymakers have been grappling.
                Specific visions for Web3 differ, and the term has been described by Bloomberg as "hazy", but they
                revolve around the idea of decentralization and often incorporate blockchain technologies, such as
                various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[5] Bloomberg has described Web3 as an idea that
                "would build financial assets, in the form of tokens, into the inner workings of almost anything you do
                online".[22] A policy brief published by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of
                Cambridge defined Web3 as "the putative next generation of the web’s technical, legal, and payments
                infrastructure—including blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies."[23] According to Liu,
                Zhuotao, et al (2021), three fundamental architectural enablers of Web3 were identified as a combination
                of decentralized or federated platforms, secured interoperability, and verifiable computing through
                distributed ledger technologies.[24]

                Some visions are based around the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).[25]
                Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another key concept; in it, users exchange currency without bank or
                government involvement.[5] Self-sovereign identity allows users to identify themselves without relying
                on an authentication system such as OAuth, in which a trusted party has to be reached in order to assess
                identity.[26] Technology scholars have argued that Web3 would likely run in tandem with Web 2.0 sites,
                with Web 2.0 sites likely adopting Web3 technologies in order to keep their services relevant.
                Kevin Werbach, author of The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,[40] has said that "many
                so-called 'Web 3.0' solutions are not as decentralized as they seem, while others have yet to show they
                are scalable, secure and accessible enough for the mass market", adding that this "may change, but it's
                not a given that all these limitations will be overcome".[41]

                In early 2022, Moxie Marlinspike, creator of Signal, articulated how Web3 is not as decentralized as it
                appears to be, mainly due to consolidation in the cryptocurrency field, including in blockchain
                application programming interfaces which is currently mainly controlled by the companies Alchemy and
                Infura, cryptocurrency exchanges which is mainly dominated by Binance, Coinbase, MetaMask, and OpenSea,
                and the stablecoin market which is currently dominated by Tether. Marlinspike also remarked that the new
                web resembles the old web.[42][43][44]

                An Ad Age article from 2022 stated "early adopters want to make a new internet that alleviates the
                problems of the old one" but said if companies put the same type people in charge as on the earlier
                version, and those people had similar attitudes, the same problems would happen.[45] Another article in
                the same issue of the magazine quoted Alex Smeele, co-founder of Non-Fungible Labs, who said companies
                that wanted to participate in Web3 were "actually going to have to rethink their entire business model.

                Ana Constantino, founder of meetup platform Nowhere, said the metaverse did not really welcome everyone,
                because owners of NFT real estate on sites such as Decentraland could keep people out who did not have
                the assets.</i>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Reception</h3>
                <i>Technologists and journalists have described Web3 as a possible solution to concerns about the over-centralization of the web in a few "Big Tech" companies.[5][21] Some have expressed the notion that Web3 could improve data security, scalability, and privacy beyond what is currently possible with Web 2.0 platforms.[28] Bloomberg states that skeptics say the idea "is a long way from proving its use beyond niche applications, many of them tools aimed at crypto traders".[22] The New York Times reported that several investors are betting $27 billion that Web3 "is the future of the internet".[29][30]

                    Some Web 2.0 companies, including Reddit and Discord, have explored incorporating Web3 technologies into their platforms.[5][31] On November 8, 2021, CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot suggesting Discord might be exploring integrating cryptocurrency wallets into their platform. Two days later, and after heavy user backlash,[31][32] Discord announced they had no plans to integrate such technologies and that it was an internal-only concept that had been developed in a company-wide hackathon.[32]
                    
                    Some legal scholars quoted by The Conversation have expressed concerns over the difficulty of regulating a decentralized web, which they reported might make it more difficult to prevent cybercrime, online harassment, hate speech, and the dissemination of child abuse images.[7] But, the news website also states that, "[decentralized web] represents the cyber-libertarian views and hopes of the past that the internet can empower ordinary people by breaking down existing power structures". Some other critics of Web3 see the concept as a part of a cryptocurrency bubble, or as an extension of blockchain-based trends that they see as overhyped or harmful, particularly NFTs.[31] Some critics have raised concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.[6] Cryptocurrencies vary in efficiency, with proof of stake having been designed to be less energy intensive than the more widely used proof of work, although there is disagreement about how secure and decentralized this is in practice.[33][34][35][36] Others have expressed beliefs that Web3 and the associated technologies are a pyramid scheme.[6]
                    
                    Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, dismissed Web3 as a "venture capitalists' plaything".[37] Dorsey opined that Web3 will not democratize the internet, but it will shift power from players like Facebook to venture capital funds like Andreessen Horowitz.</i>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Background</h3>
               <i> Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 refer to eras in the history of the World Wide Web as it evolved through various technologies and formats. Web 1.0 refers roughly to the period from 1989 to 2004, where most sites consisted of static pages, and the vast majority of users were consumers, not producers of content.[13][14] Web 2.0 is based around the idea of "the web as platform"[15] and centers on user-created content uploaded to forums, social media and networking services, blogs, and wikis, among other services.[16] Web 2.0 is generally considered to have begun around 2004 and continues to the current day.</i>
               <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Conclusion</h3>
               <i>What is the main goal of Web3?
                Our mission is to nurture cutting-edge applications for decentralized web software protocols. Our passion is delivering Web 3.0, a decentralized and fair internet where users control their own data, identity and destiny.</i>
